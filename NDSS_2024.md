Browser fingerprinting often provides an attractive alternative to third-party cookies for tracking users across the web. In fact, the increasing restrictions on third-party cookies placed by common web browsers and recent regulations like the GDPR may accelerate the transition. To counter browser fingerprinting, previous work proposed a number of techniques to detect its prevalence and severity. However, most – if not all – of those techniques rely on 1) centralized web crawls and/or 2) computationally-intensive operations to extract and process signals (e.g., information-flow and static analysis).
To address these limitations, we present FP-Fed, the first distributed system for browser fingerprinting detection. Using FP-Fed, users collaboratively train on-device models based on their real browsing patterns, without sharing their training data with a central entity, by relying on Differentially Private Federated Learning (DP-FL). To demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness, we evaluate FP-Fed’s performance on a set of 20k popular websites with different privacy levels, numbers of participants, and features extracted from the scripts. Our experiments show that FP-Fed achieves reasonably high detection performance and can perform both training and inference efficiently, on-device, by only relying on runtime signals extracted from the execution trace, without requiring any resource-intensive operation.

Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach enabling multiple clients to train Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) collaboratively without sharing their local training data. However, FL is susceptible to backdoor (or targeted poisoning) attacks. These attacks are initiated by malicious clients who seek to compromise the learning process by introducing specific behaviors into the learned model that can be triggered by carefully crafted inputs. Existing FL safeguards have various limitations: They are restricted to specific data distributions or reduce the global model accuracy due to excluding benign models or adding noise, are vulnerable to adaptive defense-aware adversaries, or require the server to access local models, allowing data inference attacks.
This paper presents a novel defense mechanism, CrowdGuard, that effectively mitigates backdoor attacks in FL and overcomes the deficiencies of existing techniques. It leverages clients' feedback on individual models, analyzes the behavior of neurons in hidden layers, and eliminates poisoned models through an iterative pruning scheme. CrowdGuard employs a server-located stacked clustering scheme to enhance its resilience to rogue client feedback. The evaluation results demonstrate that CrowdGuard achieves a 100% True-Positive-Rate and True-Negative-Rate across various scenarios, including IID and non-IID data distributions. Additionally, CrowdGuard withstands adaptive adversaries while preserving the original performance of protected models. To ensure confidentiality, CrowdGuard uses a secure and privacy-preserving architecture leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on both client and server sides.

Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models using distributed data. This approach offers benefits such as improved data privacy, reduced communication costs, and enhanced model performance through increased data diversity. However, FL systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where adversaries introduce malicious updates to compromise the integrity of the aggregated model. Existing defense strategies against such attacks include filtering, influence reduction, and robust aggregation techniques. Filtering approaches have the advantage of not reducing classification accuracy, but face the challenge of adversaries adapting to the defense mechanisms. The lack of a universally accepted definition of "adaptive adversaries" in the literature complicates the assessment of detection capabilities and meaningful comparisons of FL defenses.
In this paper, we address the limitations of the commonly used definition of "adaptive attackers" proposed by Bagdasaryan et al. We propose AutoAdapt, a novel adaptation method that leverages an Augmented Lagrangian optimization technique. AutoAdapt eliminates the manual search for optimal hyper-parameters by providing a more rational alternative. It generates more effective solutions by accommodating multiple inequality constraints, allowing adaptation to valid value ranges within the defensive metrics. Our proposed method significantly enhances adversaries' capabilities and accelerates research in developing attacks and defenses. By accommodating multiple valid range constraints and adapting to diverse defense metrics, AutoAdapt challenges defenses relying on multiple metrics and expands the range of potential adversarial behaviors. Through comprehensive studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoAdapt in simultaneously adapting to multiple constraints and showcasing its power by accelerating the performance of tests by a factor of 15. Furthermore, we establish the versatility of AutoAdapt across various application scenarios, encompassing datasets, model architectures, and hyper-parameters, emphasizing its practical utility in real-world contexts. Overall, our contributions advance the evaluation of FL defenses and drive progress in this field.

Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm allowing multiple clients to jointly train a model without sharing their training data. However, FL is susceptible to poisoning attacks, in which the adversary injects manipulated model updates into the federated model aggregation process to corrupt or destroy predictions (untargeted poisoning) or implant hidden functionalities (targeted poisoning or backdoors). Existing defenses against poisoning attacks in FL have several limitations, such as relying on specific assumptions about attack types and strategies or data distributions or not sufficiently robust against advanced injection techniques and strategies and simultaneously maintaining the utility of the aggregated model.
To address the deficiencies of existing defenses, we take a generic and completely different approach to detect poisoning (targeted and untargeted) attacks. We present FreqFed, a novel aggregation mechanism that transforms the model updates (i.e., weights) into the frequency domain, where we can identify the core frequency components that inherit sufficient information about weights. This allows us to effectively filter out malicious updates during local training on the clients, regardless of attack types, strategies, and clients' data distributions. We extensively evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of FreqFed in different application domains, including image classification, word prediction, IoT intrusion detection, and speech recognition. We demonstrate that FreqFed can mitigate poisoning attacks effectively with a negligible impact on the utility of the aggregated model.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are ubiquitous middleboxes designed to enhance the performance of hosted websites and shield them from various attacks. Numerous notable studies show that CDNs modify a client's request when forwarding it to the original server. Multiple inconsistencies in this forwarding operation have been found to potentially result in security vulnerabilities like DoS attacks. Nonetheless, existing research lacks a systematic approach to studying CDN forwarding request inconsistencies.
In this work, we present ReqsMiner, an innovative fuzzing framework developed to discover previously unexamined inconsistencies in CDN forwarding requests. The framework uses techniques derived from reinforcement learning to generate valid test cases, even with minimal feedback, and incorporates real field values into the grammar-based fuzzer. With the help of ReqsMiner, we comprehensively test 22 major CDN providers and uncover a wealth of hitherto unstudied CDN forwarding request inconsistencies. Moreover, the application of specialized analyzers enables ReqsMiner to extend its capabilities, evolving into a framework capable of detecting specific types of attacks. By extension, our work further identifies three novel types of HTTP amplification DoS attacks and uncovers 74 new potential DoS vulnerabilities with an amplification factor that can reach up to 2,000 generally, and even 1,920,000 under specific conditions. The vulnerabilities detected were responsibly disclosed to the affected CDN vendors, and mitigation suggestions were proposed. Our work contributes to fortifying CDN security, thereby enhancing their resilience against malicious attacks and preventing misuse.

RDMA is being widely used from private data center applications to multi-tenant clouds, which makes RDMA security gain tremendous attention. However, existing RDMA security studies mainly focus on the security of RDMA systems, and the security of the coupled traffic control mechanisms (represented by PFC and DCQCN) in RDMA networks is largely overlooked. In this paper, through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that concurrent short-duration bursts can cause drastic performance loss on flows across multiple hops via the interaction between PFC and DCQCN. And we also summarize the vulnerabilities between the performance loss and the burst peak rate, as well as the duration. Based on these vulnerabilities, we propose the LoRDMA attack, a low-rate DoS attack against RDMA traffic control mechanisms. By monitoring RTT as the feedback signal, LoRDMA can adaptively 1) coordinate the bots to different target switch ports to cover more victim flows efficiently; 2) schedule the burst parameters to cause significant performance loss efficiently. We conduct and evaluate the LoRDMA attack at both ns-3 simulations and a cloud RDMA cluster. The results show that compared to existing attacks, the LoRDMA attack achieves higher victim flow coverage and performance loss with much lower attack traffic and detectability. And the communication performance of typical distributed machine learning training applications (NCCL Tests) in the cloud RDMA cluster can be degraded from 18.23% to 56.12% under the LoRDMA attack.

Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) attacks have plagued modern enterprises, causing significant financial losses. To counter these attacks, researchers propose techniques that capture the complex and stealthy scenarios of APT attacks by using provenance graphs to model system entities and their dependencies. Particularly, to accelerate attack detection and reduce financial losses, online provenance-based detection systems that detect and investigate APT attacks under the constraints of timeliness and limited resources are in dire need. Unfortunately, existing online systems usually sacrifice detection granularity to reduce computational complexity and produce provenance graphs with more than 100,000 nodes, posing challenges for security admins to interpret the detection results. In this paper, we design and implement NodLink, the first online detection system that maintains high detection accuracy without sacrificing detection granularity. Our insight is that the APT attack detection process in online provenance-based detection systems can be modeled as a Steiner Tree Problem (STP), which has efficient online approximation algorithms that recover concise attack-related provenance graphs with a theoretically bounded error. To utilize the frameworks of the STP approximation algorithm for APT attack detection, we propose a novel design of in-memory cache, an efficient attack screening method, and a new STP approximation algorithm that is more efficient than the conventional one in APT attack detection while maintaining the same complexity. We evaluate NodLink in a production environment. The open-world experiment shows that NodLink outperforms two state-of-the-art (SOTA) online provenance analysis systems by achieving magnitudes higher detection and investigation accuracy while having the same or higher throughput.
